# vagrant-files
This repository simply tracks any vagrantfiles I create.

To use, you need to install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/installation). Because all vagrantfiles are literally called "Vagrantfile", each vagrantfile is placed a directory named for the project it supports. Make sure you run `vagrant up` from the directory containing the vagrantfile you need.
